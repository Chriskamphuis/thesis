\section{Results}
Recall the main research question, and its subquestions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ: How can information retrieval benefit from graph databases and graph query languages?}
	
	\item \emph{RQ1: What are the benefits of using relational databases for information retrieval?} 
	\item \emph{RQ2: Can we extend the benefits from using relational databases for information retrieval to using graph databases, while being able to express graph related problems easier?} 
	\item \emph{RQ3: When does information retrieval research benefits from graph data?} 
\end{itemize}
